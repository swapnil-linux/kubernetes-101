## Creating a cluster with kubeadm

Using `kubeadm`, you can create a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. In fact, you can use `kubeadm` to set up a cluster that will pass the [Kubernetes Conformance tests](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/10/software-conformance-certification). `kubeadm` also supports other cluster lifecycle functions, such as [bootstrap tokens](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) and cluster upgrades.

The `kubeadm` tool is good if you need:

* A simple way for you to try out Kubernetes, possibly for the first time.
* A way for existing users to automate setting up a cluster and test their application.
* A building block in other echosystem and/or installer tools with a larger scope.

You can install and use `kubeadm` on various machines: your laptop, a set of cloud servers, a Raspberry Pi, and more. Whether you're deploying into the cloud or on-premises, you can integrate `kubeadm` into provisioning systems such as Ansible or Terraform.
